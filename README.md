### Summary
  EMC Isilon scale-out storage solutions are designed for the enterprise that want to manage their data, not their storage. Our storage systems are powerful yet simple to install, manage, and scale to virtually any size. And, unlike traditional enterprise storage, Isilon solutions stay simple no matter how much storage capacity is added, how much performance is required, or how business needs change in the future. We’re challenging enterprises to think differently about their storage, because when they do, they’ll recognize there’s a better, simpler way – with Isilon.
  The script utilizing Isilon Platform API interface to back up shares, exports, schedules and quotas for use cases such as: DRP and backup necessary configuration for DR.

### Install
  Create and restore shares, exports, snapshot schedules  and quotas on an Isilon system utilizing the REST API interface. 
  This script was written against Python 2.7.8 and will require the requests (2.4.3 or newer) package to be installed using:<br>
  
      pip install requests
      pip install requests --upgrade (if using an older version of requests)
  The script has been tested on python 2.6 on both Linux (FreeBSD – Isilon OS) and windows 7 with OneFS 7.0.x and 7.1.x.

### Usage
      usage: isi_tools.py [-h] [-v] [-f FILE] -t TYPE -u USER -pw PASSWORD -n

### Running Isilon Tools

As an alternative to passing a password on the command-line with --password (which can be unsafe), you can specify the password in the
environment variable ISI_TOOLS_PASSWORD.

* The default path for the backup file is “./archive”, in case the path is not exist the backup file will be saved on the current directory.

* The name of the backup file is build from the type and date&time which the file was created. For example: quotas_29_12_18_11.bck is back file of quotas which was taken on December 29 in 6:11.

        isi_tools.py restore --user root --password a --name isi-lab.ps --type exports --file ./archive/exports_29_12_18_9.bck

        isi_tools.py backup --user root --password a --name isi-lab.ps --type all

        isi_tools.py delete --user root --password a --name isi-lab.ps --type exports

        isi_tools.py delete --user root --password a --name isi-lab.ps --type all

*Note: As you can see in the screenshot above an error returned while the script was tried to create an export. This is OK, the script is just raising the API error he gets in case of an exception, In this case the export which I was trying to create is already exist.*

### Use Cases & Recommendations
**For replications:**<br>
My recommendation is to schedule this script to back up your system configuration with the backup operation and use SyncIQ (if you have license) or other method to move the .bck files to the remote system.<br> 
Restore the backup file on the remote system only on the time of the failover and on schedule.

**For Back up:**<br>
Schedule the script to back up your system configuration and save it somewhere else (Not only on the Isilon system).
